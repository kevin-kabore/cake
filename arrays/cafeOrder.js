/**
 * 
 * My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.
 * 
 * I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one list for the
 * kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.
 * 
 * Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!
 * 
 * To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:
 * The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (takeOut)
 * The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dineIn)
 * Each customer order as it was finished by the kitchen. (servedOrders)
 * Given all three arrays, write a function to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.
 * 
 * We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.
 *
